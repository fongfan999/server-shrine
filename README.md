# Wot Da Shrine 🪔

When the servers are down, the team prays together. Open a shrine, send the
link to your teammates, and light incense, ring the bowl, bow, make offerings
and send prayers to the rack, all in real time on one shared altar.

Inspired by every "I haven't been able to reach the server for an hour" thread,
and the classic photo of sysadmins praying to a rack with incense. A
[Wot Da Fong](https://wotdafong.dev/) project.

Open source at [github.com/fongfan999/wot-da-shrine](https://github.com/fongfan999/wot-da-shrine).
Issues and pull requests are welcome.

Built with [Vite](https://vite.dev), [GSAP](https://gsap.com) and the Web Audio
API, running on [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)
with a [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) per
shrine.

## How it works

- `/` is a solo shrine. It also works as a maintenance page (custom title,
  subtitle and "back at" time).
- `/new` redirects to a freshly named shared shrine, e.g. `/r/serene-rack-42`.
- `/r/:room` asks for a name and avatar, then joins that room's `Shrine`
  Durable Object over a WebSocket. The room keeps the shared state: who is
  here, incense burn time, karma, the offerings on the table and the last 12
  prayers. Late joiners see the incense mid-burn and the prayers they missed.
- Durable Objects use the WebSocket Hibernation API, so idle shrines cost
  nothing. A shrine nobody visits for 30 days deletes itself.

## Features

- **Shared altar**: everyone sees and hears every action, and the activity
  feed shows who did what (repeats fold into "rang the bowl ×3").
- **The congregation**: everyone in the room kneels in front of the altar with
  their name above them, in rows when the team is big. They bow when they
  bow, and their prayer lanterns rise from where they kneel.
- **Rack 42 vitals**: a heart monitor that flatlines while the incense is cold
  and beats faster with more people and more devotion, with a mood face to
  match.
- **The offering tray**: pick what the servers get (energy drink, noodles,
  rubber duck, the backups…) or roll the dice. `O` still offers at random.
- **Quick prayers**: three ready-made prayers under the altar, reshuffled
  every time you use one.
- **The wish board**: every prayer also hangs on the altar as a wooden plaque,
  and a shared shrine restores the last six for late joiners.
- **Bowl combos**: ring fast, or ring together, and the combo counter climbs
  from "the rack hears you" to "enlightenment achieved". Each ring in a combo
  sits a little higher than the last.
- **Ranks**: karma promotes you from lurker in #incidents to enlightened SRE,
  with a toast and a shower of petals at every promotion.
- **Effects levels**: phones, small tablets and anything that reports a weak
  CPU get *lite* effects (no fog, fewer particles, flames that flicker at
  6 fps instead of 60). Desktops start with
  the full set and drop to lite for the session if the frame rate falls below
  40 fps after the intro. Pick one yourself under Customize, or with `?fx=lite`
  / `?fx=full`. Lite mode, and any shrine nobody has touched for 90 seconds,
  runs the whole scene at 30 fps; a cold altar draws nothing at all.
- **Atmosphere**: a camera push down the server corridor on load, dust over
  the altar, sparks when the incense catches, and cobalt shockwaves across the
  floor when the bowl rings.
- **Drawn, not downloaded**: the whole scene is an ink line drawing on
  notebook paper, in the Wot Da Fong brand. The incense burner is inline SVG
  (the sticks really burn down), the server room is procedural, the smoke is
  painted at runtime, and the ambient music is synthesized in the browser.
- **Light and dark**: paper by day, a night vigil after dark. It follows the
  system setting unless you pick one.
- **Customizable**: title, subtitle, "back at" time, theme, toggles for
  music/effects/petals/fog. Open the settings panel or use URL params.
- **Keyboard**: `L` light · `B` bowl · `P` bow · `O` offer · `Space` breathe ·
  `M` mute · `T` theme.
- **Worker API**: `GET /api/status` (JSON), `GET /api/health` (`om`),
  `GET /api/rooms/:room/ws` (WebSocket).

## URL parameters

| Param      | Values                                   | Example                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `title`    | any text                                 | `?title=Back+in+5+minutes`     |
| `subtitle` | any text                                 | `?subtitle=Deploying+v2.0`     |
| `eta`      | ISO 8601 date/time                       | `?eta=2026-10-14T18:30:00Z`    |
| `theme`    | `auto` `light` `dark`                    | `?theme=dark`                  |
| `music` `sfx` `petals` `fog` | `1` / `0`              | `?petals=0&fog=0`              |

They work on room pages too: `/r/serene-rack-42?theme=dark`.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite + the Worker and Durable Object in workerd, http://localhost:5173
```

`npm run preview` builds and serves the production bundle locally.

## Deploy

```bash
npx wrangler login # once
npm run deploy
```

It deploys to https://shrine.wotdafong.dev as a Workers custom domain (the
`wotdafong.dev` zone must be on the same Cloudflare account). The
`*.workers.dev` URL and preview URLs are turned off in `wrangler.jsonc`.
